        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. Here you will learn a little bit about me as a person as well as some of the work of done through MSU's Game Dev program. I am a 22 year old undergraduate student and aspiring game designer currently attending Michigan State University. My major is Media and Information and I am also a part of MSU's acredited Game Design and Development Minor. I am extremely passionate about video games, with some of my favorites being the Halo Series and Mass Effect.</p>
